## Using `mesheryctl`

`mesheryctl` is the command line interface to manage Meshery and interface with its functionality using a terminal.

`mesheryctl` allows you to control Meshery's lifecycle with commands like `start`, `stop`, `status`, `reset`. Running `reset` will remove all active container instances, prune pulled images and remove any local volumes created by starting Meshery. For more command cases, refer to our exhaustive list of [mesheryctl commands](/docs/guides/mesheryctl-commands).

To upgrade an existing version of mesheryctl installed on your local system, refer to the [mesheryctl upgradation guide](/docs/guides/upgrade)

# Advanced Installation

Users can control the specific container image and tag (version) of Meshery that they would like to run by editing their local `~/.meshery/meshery.yaml` (a docker compose file).
Aligned with the Meshery container image, instead of leaving the implicit `:stable-latest` tag behind image: layer5/meshery, users will instead identify a specific image tag like so:

```bash
version: '3'
services:
  meshery:
    image: layer5/meshery:v0.5.0
    labels:
      - "com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true"
```
